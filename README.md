## Hovercraft Project BW-1

##Overview
This project documents the design, thought process, skills learned, and construction of a hovercraft. The goal is too explore how airflow and fluid dnymaics interact to create hovercraft lift and thrust. Lift, skirt design, modularity, thrust effeciency, and real world engineering tradeoffs will be explored and discovered.

##Reason
I am an aspiring aerospace and mechanical engineer, specifically propulsion, who wants to take a step forward in my own skills and understanding through my hovercraft project. This project gives me a test platform where I can more easily understand and document fundemental thrust and fluid dynamic properties. I also wish to use this project to increase my skills in CAD Design, programming, and small electronics. 

##Curent Status
-Concept Design
-Initial lift and Thrust calculations
-Documentation Setup
-Materials gathering and start of frame construction

##Key Engineering questions
How much lift preassure is required for stable hover, and later hover over larger obstacles?
How should airflow be split between lift and thrust?
What are the real world applications of this project?
How does a hovercraft teach me more about propulsion?
How can I introduce ingenuity into this hovercraft and make it different?

##Skills Learned/Mastered
Basic Fusion 360 CADing
Power tool usage combined with physical construction using plywood
Fiberglassing + Epoxy Resin application

## Next Steps
Finish inner and outer structure
CAD plenum ring + chamber
Increase modularity of frame, and once finalized, expoxy + fiberglass coat
Install/CAD engine, fan, seats, compartments, etc.
Install Electonics and plenum flap
Paint and skirt installation
